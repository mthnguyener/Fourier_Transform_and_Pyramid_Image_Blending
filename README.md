# Fourier_Transform_and_Pyramid_Image_Blending

In this project we go over some basic Fourier Transformation and implemented a few blendings methods: pyramind blending (manual), pyramid blending (cv2) and poisson image blending.

These attached papers were used to help explain the methods in details.
